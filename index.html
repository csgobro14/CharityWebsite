      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Millions of people still lack access to clean, safe drinking water. Our mission is to change thatâ€”one village, one pump, and one child at a time. With your help, we can create a future where clean water is not a privilege, but a basic human right.

      <h2>Real Impact: Meet Amina</h2>
      <p>
        Amina used to walk miles every day to collect water for her family. Thanks to your support, her village now has a clean water well. Amina can go to school, and her family is healthier and happier.
